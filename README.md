**metapak** is a modern, terminal-based user interface for managing packages. It creates a unified experience for searching, installing, and removing packages across system package managers (pacman, apt, dnf, zypper, brew, scoop, apk) and language ecosystems (npm, pip, cargo), all without ever leaving the TUI.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Package Management
*   **Universal Search**: Query both **System Repositories** (pacman, apt, brew, scoop, apk) and **Language Ecosystems** (npm, pip, cargo) simultaneously.
*   **Batch Operations**: Select multiple packages using `Tab` and install/remove them in a single transaction.
*   **Live Search**: Search as you type with debounced queries.
*   **Fuzzy Matching**: Find packages even with partial or typo-prone queries.
*   **Pre/Post Hooks**: Execute custom shell commands before or after package operations.

### System Views
*   **Updates View** (`U`): View and manage available system updates.
*   **System Info** (`I`): CPU, RAM, uptime, OS details, desktop environment.
*   **Diagnostics** (`h`): Check pacman status, AUR helper, disk space.
*   **Foreign Packages** (`F`): View AUR/explicitly installed packages.
*   **Package Groups** (`G`): Browse and manage package groups.
*   **Package Sizes** (`P`): See top 30 largest installed packages.
*   **Orphan Packages** (`O`): Find unrequired packages.
*   **Cache Info** (`C`): View pacman and AUR cache sizes.

### Native TUI Experience
*   **Runtime Theme Switching**: Cycle between beautiful dark and light themes (Mocha/Latte) instantly using `T` or `Shift+T`.
*   **i18n Support**: Auto-detected or configurable language localization.
*   **Startup Sudo Cache**: Enter your password once at launch; no interruptions during installation.
*   **Embedded Console**: Watch build logs and installation output directly inside the UI.
*   **Safe Conflict Resolution**: Automatic safety checks and conflict parsing before executing any system changes.
*   **Dependency Visualization** (`v`): View package dependency trees.
*   **Toasts & Animations**: Smooth UI feedback.

### Backup & Recovery
*   **System Backup**: Export explicit packages to `~/.config/metapak/backups/` for disaster recovery.
*   **Restore**: Use `pacman -S --needed < backup.txt` to restore.

### Robustness
*   **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic protection against external service outages.
*   **Graceful Shutdown**: Ctrl+C safely closes the application.
*   **Telemetry**: Built-in structured operations logging with automatic log rotation.
*   **Input Validation**: Sanitized package names and paths.
*   **Search Limits**: Configurable result limits to prevent memory exhaustion.

## 📦 Installation

You can install metapak using the included automated script.

### Prerequisites

## Configuration

metapak reads configuration from `~/.config/metapak/config.toml`. A full example with defaults is in `config.example.toml` at the project root.

### Theme

```toml
[theme]
preset = "mocha"   # "mocha" (dark), "latte" (light), "dark", "light", or "custom"
# Color overrides (optional):
# primary_color = "#89b4fa"
# secondary_color = "#fab387"
# accent_color = "#a6e3a1"
```

Colors can be hex strings, named colors (`blue`, `red`, `green`, etc.), or RGB objects `{ r = 137, g = 180, b = 250 }`.

### AUR Helper

```toml
aur_helper = "auto"   # "auto", "yay", "paru", or "pacman"
```

### Keyboard Bindings

All keys are fully customizable under `[keyboard]`. Default bindings:

| Key | Default |
|-----|---------|
| `quit` | `"q"` |
| `search` | `"/"` |
| `install` | `"enter"` |
| `toggle_selection` | `"tab"` |
| `next_page` | `"n"` |
| `prev_page` | `"p"` |
| `next` | `"j"` |
| `prev` | `"k"` |
| `help` | `"?"` |
| `history` | `"t"` |
| `diagnostics` | `"h"` |
| `filter` | `"f"` |
| `sort` | `"s"` |
| `undo` | `"u"` |
| `details` | `"d"` |
| `dependencies` | `"v"` |
| `sidebar` | `"\\"` |
| `refresh` | `"r"` |
| `update` | `"U"` |
| `rollback` | `"R"` |

### UI

```toml
[ui]
items_per_page = 20
search_debounce_ms = 300
max_search_history = 50
max_undo_history = 20
auto_check_updates = false
update_check_interval_minutes = 60
auto_update_on_startup = false
```

### Search

```toml
[search]
cache_ttl_seconds = 300   # How long to cache search results
```

### Robustness

```toml
[robustness]
snapshot_keep_count = 5    # Number of btrfs snapshots to keep
simulation_backend = "auto" # "auto" or "mock"
```

### Hooks

Execute custom shell commands before or after package operations:

```toml
[hooks]
pre_install = ["echo 'Starting installation...'"]
post_install = ["echo 'Installation complete!'"]
pre_remove = []
post_remove = []
pre_update = []
post_update = []
```

### Internationalization

```toml
[i18n]
language = "auto"   # "auto", "en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh", "ja"
```

When set to `"auto"`, metapak detects the system locale automatically.

### Notifications

```toml
[notifications]
enabled = true
on_install = true
on_update = true
on_error = true
```

### Telemetry

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = true          # Operation logging
max_log_size_mb = 5     # Max log file size before rotation
max_log_files = 5       # Number of rotated log files to keep
```

## View Reference

metapak provides several specialized views accessible via keyboard shortcuts:

### Updates View (`U`)
Shows all available package updates from your configured repositories. Displays package name, current version, and new version. Press `Shift+U` to upgrade all packages.

### Diagnostics (`h`)
System health overview: package manager status, AUR helper detection, disk space usage, database lock status. Useful for troubleshooting.

### System Info (`I`)
Hardware and OS overview: CPU model and usage, total and used RAM, system uptime, OS name and kernel version, desktop environment.

### Orphan Packages (`O`)
Lists packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer required by any installed package. Useful for cleanup.

### Package Sizes (`P`)
Top 30 largest installed packages sorted by installed size. Helps identify disk space usage.

### Cache Info (`C`)
Shows package manager cache sizes (pacman, AUR helper caches). Helps manage disk space.

### Foreign Packages (`F`)
Lists explicitly installed packages from AUR or other external sources (not from the main repositories).

### Package Groups (`G`)
Browse and manage package groups. Select a group to see its member packages and install/remove them.

### Dependency Tree (`v`)
Visualizes package dependencies as an interactive tree. Select a package to see what it depends on and what depends on it.

## Troubleshooting

### "sudo password prompt fails or loops"
Use the startup password prompt to cache your sudo credentials for the session. If you dismiss it, you'll be prompted during operations. On systems without sudo (e.g., some containers), run metapak as root.

### "Search returns no results"
- Ensure at least one supported package manager is installed
- Check that the package name is correct (typos tolerated — fuzzy matching is enabled)
- Check network connectivity if searching AUR

### "AUR helper not detected"
metapak auto-detects `yay` and `paru`. Set `aur_helper = "yay"` explicitly in `config.toml` if auto-detection fails.

### "Operation hangs or is slow"
- Large repository updates (especially `apt update`) can take time
- The search debounce (300ms by default) adds a small delay before executing queries
- Check `[ui] search_debounce_ms` in config to tune responsiveness

### "Windows: scoop commands fail"
Ensure Scoop is installed and in your PATH. Run `scoop help` in PowerShell to verify.

### "Error: database locked"
Another package manager instance (e.g., `apt`, `pacman`) is running. Close it and retry.

### "How do I reset the configuration?"
Delete `~/.config/metapak/config.toml` — metapak will use built-in defaults. The example config at `config.example.toml` shows all options.

## 🛠️ Architecture

metapak is built in **Rust** for speed and safety. The architecture follows an action-driven, async-first design:

```
src/
├── main.rs              # Entry point, CLI parsing, event loop
├── app.rs               # Application state (App struct, mode management)
├── ui.rs                # TUI rendering (Ratatui)
├── services.rs          # Package service layer (search, install, remove)
├── backends/
│   ├── mod.rs
│   └── snapshots/       # Snapshot providers (btrfs, timeshift)
├── config.rs            # Configuration loading from TOML
├── search.rs            # Fuzzy search with query syntax
├── traits.rs            # PackageProvider, PackageSimulator traits
├── hooks.rs             # Pre/post operation shell hooks
├── i18n.rs              # Internationalization subsystem
├── theme.rs             # Dynamic theming (Catppuccin palettes)
├── diagnostics.rs       # System diagnostics collection
├── notifications.rs     # Desktop notification support
├── telemetry.rs         # Operation logging with rotation
├── transaction_manager.rs # Safe orchestration of system changes
├── watchdog.rs          # Health monitoring / circuit breaker
├── simulation.rs        # Dry-run simulation engine
├── models.rs            # Core data types (Package, PackageSource)
├── errors.rs            # Custom error types
└── ...                  # Supporting modules
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Action-Driven State**: UI state updates via `Action` messages sent through async channels — decouples rendering from backend logic
- **Trait-Based Backends**: Package managers implement the `PackageProvider` trait for pluggable, testable backends
- **Async First**: Most I/O is non-blocking using `tokio` — search, install, updates all run in background tasks
- **Circuit Breaker**: AUR API calls protected by a circuit breaker to handle outages gracefully
- **Robustness Suite**: Simulation engine for dry-run testing, health watchdog, and snapshot providers for system safety
